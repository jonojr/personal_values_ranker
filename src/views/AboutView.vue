    <h1>About</h1>
    <p>Ever been asked about your values?</p>
    <p>Been given a bunch of cards to sort?</p>
    <p>Ordering 100 values is an overwhelming task, so I built a tool to help.</p>
    <p>This tool uses the elo ranking algorithm to let people rank their central values by choosing which value of a pair is more important to them</p>
    <p>Doing this a number of times this page will give you your preferences in order.</p>
